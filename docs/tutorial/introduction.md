# Introduction

!!! info "tldr"
    `cfa` aims to create an oppinionated way to develop FastAPI applications, achieving faster development, better code readability and fewer code mistakes

---

## What is this?

Just a project template. In teams with lots and lots of projects, it is easy to lose track of how projects are configured. Code readability should be valued and one way of achieving this is to set some standards.

This project does just that. It creates a working [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) template ready to use with sql databases. The `cfa create` script will automatically initialize a git repo for you, create app file structure, include working (and relatively small) `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose` and optional script for creating [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).

## Why should I use it?

I am not forcing you to do so. And I am not even saying that this is the best way to use FastAPI. However, we found that this template works well and have created lots of projects based on it.

You should not reinvent the wheel. Your time is more valuable :wink:
